// \ingroup math
//
// The math serialization module provides the functionality to create platform independent,
// portable, binary representations of vectors and matrices. The resulting data structures
// can be used to reconstitute the vectors and matrices in a different context, on another
// platform, etc.
//
// The following example demonstrates the functionality of this module by means of vectors:

   \code
   using blaze::columnVector;
   using blaze::rowVector;

   // Serialization of both vectors
   {
      blaze::StaticVector<double,5UL,rowVector> d;
      blaze::CompressedVector<int,columnVector> s;

      // ... Resizing and initialization

      // Creating an archive that writes into a the file "vectors.blaze"
      blaze::Archive<std::ofstream> archive( "vectors.blaze" );

      // Serialization of both vectors into the same archive. Note that d lies before s!
      archive << d << s;
   }

   // Reconstitution of both vectors
   {
      blaze::DynamicVector<double,rowVector> d1;
      blaze::DynamicVector<int,rowVector> d2;

      // Creating an archive that reads from the file "vectors.blaze"
      blaze::Archive<std::ofstream> archive( "vectors.blaze" );

      // Reconstituting the former d vector into d1. Note that it is possible to reconstitute
      // the vector into a differrent kind of vector (StaticVector -> DynamicVector), but that
      // the type of elements has to be the same.
      archive >> d1;

      // Reconstituting the former s vector into d2. Note that is is even possible to reconstitute
      // a sparse vector as a dense vector (also the reverse is possible) and that a column vector
      // can be reconstituted as row vector (and vice versa). Note however that also in this case
      // the type of elements is the same!
      archive >> d2
   }
   \endcode

// The (de-)serialization of vectors is not restricted to vectors of built-in data type, but can
// also be used for vectors with vector or matrix element type:

   \code
   // Serialization
   {
      blaze::CompressedVector< blaze::DynamicVector< blaze::complex<double> > > vec;

      // ... Resizing and initialization

      // Creating an archive that writes into a the file "vector.blaze"
      blaze::Archive<std::ofstream> archive( "vector.blaze" );

      // Serialization of the vector into the archive
      archive << vec;
   }

   // Deserialization
   {
      blaze::CompressedVector< blaze::DynamicVector< blaze::complex<double> > > vec;

      // Creating an archive that reads from the file "vector.blaze"
      blaze::Archive<std::ofstream> archive( "vector.blaze" );

      // Reconstitution of the vector from the archive
      archive >> vec;
   }
   \endcode
